CP DEVOPS ASSIGNMENT

Tomcat Sample application, built and monitored using Ansible


This playbook assumes that the server running it has:

Ansible 2.X
Python 3.6+ (with pytest)
Docker
Port 8080 is available
Internet access to pull the Tomcat docker image and python and ansible dependencies


To run, the path where the files are located must be provided as a variable.:

$ ansible-playbook tomcat.yml -e path=/opt/homework

The playbook is organized using block/rescue:

It will first install python dependencies if needed, then run the tests contained within
test_tomcat.py using pytest. 

If the exit code is not 0, one or more asserts have failed, and the rescue tasks are executed.
They will build the docker image and run it, installing ansible galaxy docker module if needed.
